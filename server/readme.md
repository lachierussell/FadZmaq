## Setup
To run the server you will need postgres installed
- Build the databse and test database from the scripts, you will need to enter your postgres password.
This will create a fadzmaq and fadzmaq_test database in postgres
- Tests should work correctly at this stage, but to run the server proper you will need to enter the fadzmaq database 
credentials into fadzmaq.conf
- Once this is configured you can run the server from the scripts

## Testing
You can also test the server by running the test script, it will also give you the code coverage

Apologies for the briefness of this readme, I'll improve it later! -Jordan

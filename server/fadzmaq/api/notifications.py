## @brief Sends a notification to the last device used by a user.
# Using Google firebase device registration tokens and FCM a notification will be sent to the last connected device.
# This is stored and updated via the `/account/ping` route.
#
# @param id     The user id to notify.
# @warning      No indication is returned as to the success of this function. If a user does not have a registered
# device they will not receive the notification.

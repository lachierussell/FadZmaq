## @brief Votes a user. The type of vote is dependant on param vote.
# @param uid    Your user id.
# @param id     Their user id.
# @param vote   True for a like, False for a pass.
# @return An object indicating whether the vote resulted in a match.
# @note This is not JSON. To convert to JSON use `jsonify()`.
# @warning This function has been modified for testing. A vote on a test user will result in a
# match 1/3 of the time.

# @returns A value indicating compatibility. Lower is better.

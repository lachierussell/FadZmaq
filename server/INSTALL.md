Once this has installed, it should be as simple as following the commands into a sh compatible terminal bellow, denoted with $	


```sh
$	pip3 install pipenv
$	git clone https://github.com/22257963/CITS3200.git

To activate this project's virtualenv, run pipenv shell.
Alternatively, run a command inside the virtualenv with pipenv run.

$	pipenv run python fadzmaq.py 

 * Serving Flask app "api" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

You now have the web server running. You can access it by typing http://127.0.0.1:5000/ into your browser.

## Windows

1. Run Windows Power Shell as Administrator
2. Run the following command in Power Shell

```
pip install pipenv
```

Once this has installed 

```powershell
$	git clone https://github.com/22257963/CITS3200.git

$	cd CITS3200\server

$	pipenv install --dev

$	pipenv run python fadzmaq.py 

 * Serving Flask app "api" (lazy loading)

   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

The web server should now be running. To check it works, try opening the address inside your browser.

*I am unsure of command output and I am not able to test due to a deficiency in a windows device.*

# Server Deployment

This is the folder for server deployment on the deploy branch.
I think we need a better way to deploy. Since we aim to move from a dev branch to a dep branch in a single sweep. So moving stuff into a special folder doesnt really make sense.

I think this will stick around until *phase 3* of the deployment strategy. That way the front-end has a server to test with static JSON.
